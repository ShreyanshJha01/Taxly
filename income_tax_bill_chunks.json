Accordingly, the \nIncome-tax Bill, 2025 has been prepared which proposes to repeal and replace the \nIncome-tax Act, 1961. \nThe Notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions contained in \nthe Bill. \nNEW DELHI;\n    NIRMALA SITHARAMAN. \nThe 8th February, 2025. \n567 \n_____ \nPRESIDENT’S RECOMMENDATION UNDER ARTICLE 117 OF THE \nCONSTITUTION OF INDIA\n_____ \n [Copy of letter No. 370134/18/2025 - TPL dated 10 February 2025 from \nSmt.
